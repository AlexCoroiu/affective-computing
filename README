To run the program you need to run classifier.py. The program will:

-extract data from srt
-build feature vectors according to the desired feature combination
-fine tune parameters for the classifiers
-run each classifier 10 times and print the results

createData.py line 15: change the feature combination to be used [0,1,2]
classifier.py line 12: change the name of the file used to output results from the grid search.
